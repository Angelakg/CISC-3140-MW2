My name is Angela Goh.
I am in my junior year of college. My majors are Multimedia Computing and BA in Digital Art. 
I have an interest in game development and illustration. Ideally I would like a career in the video game industry. 
I have minimal experiences within my fields of interests. However, I have done a technology fellowship, attended hackathons and game jams, and am a tutor with a focus on computer science.
My hobbies are playing games, reading, and drawing.
